### Getting Started

- [Night-In](https://night-in.herokuapp.com/)

- The user loads up the app and is presented with two groups of dropdown menus representing options to fetch both a movie and recipe.

- The user then makes a selection for a movie based on genre and the app randomly selects a movie from the database and provides them with a the movie title, year of release, and link for them to watch the movie.

- To pair with the movie they are watching the user also selects a recipe at random based on the food category they selected such as vegetarian, pasta, beef, etc. They are then provided with the recipe, list of ingredients, as well as steps to prepare the course.

- Additionally, the user has the option to register and save favorite recipes and movies.

### Known Issues

- Sometimes ingredients and instructions will be cut off on the edges when using smaller viewports.

### Next Steps

- Save user food and movie preferences to create a "random night" feature that will select a movie and recipe with one click.

- Send ingredients and cooking instructions to a provided phone number using an SMS api.
